# matching-game
Feb(9/22):
I have started working on my project named "Matching game", a computer science assignment. I have created a 2D array of strings (5x5) and each element has its secret and each secret has the fate of whoever uncovers it. I have to be creative as possible in tring to make this as interesting as possible. It is time I work towards improving my coding skills so as to reach the next level of excellence and that starts by stretching my creativity.
